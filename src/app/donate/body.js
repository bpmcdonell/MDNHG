				The Maryland Nurse Honor Guard&#39;s mission is to provide
				tributes to all nurses in the State of Maryland free of charge
				to their families. In order to do this we rely on nurse
				volunteers giving of their own time and expense to perform our
				tribute services, and the generosity of donors to help us to
				continue to serve families at no cost.
			</p>
			<p className="my-2 text-base">
				Donations are used to purchase supplies for our services such as
				nursing lamps, roses, chimes, tablecloths, blankets, ribbons,
				printing supplies, fund raising supplies and other necessary
				purchases to provide free tributes to families of nurses. If we
				have any residual funds after our expenses we hope to develop a
				scholarship offering or other financial assistance for nursing
				students.
