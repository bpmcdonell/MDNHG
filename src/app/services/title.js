                The Maryland Nurse Honor Guard can attend memorial services for
                any Maryland professional nurse including for Licensed Practical
                Nurses (LPNs), Registered Nurses (RNs), or advanced practice
                nurses (APRNs,) such as nurse practitioners (CRNPs) or nurse
                anesthetists (CRNAs) for examples.

            <p>
                We provide tributes at any type of memorial service including
                funerals, graveside, interment, or celebrations of life. Also,
                we provide Living Tributes for retired Maryland nurses who may
                be in memory care or hospice to honor them in person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our services are provided free of charge to families across the
                State of Maryland based on the availability of volunteers.
