			<p>
				The memorial Nightingale Tribute is comforting to the family in
				honoring their loved one&#39;s memory and helping provide
				closure. Also, it offers fellow nurses an opportunity to
				commemorate and recognize their colleague's work while
				recognizing that nurse's unique contribution and dedication to
				healthcare.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a short ceremony (generally 2-5 minutes) and can be placed
				anywhere within the service appropriate to the traditions and
				beliefs of the recipient&#39;s faith. We are non-denominational
				and welcome all backgrounds, cultures and faiths to receive our
				services.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can help coordinate the tribute within the service in
				collaboration with the family, funeral home and place of worship
				as appropriate, and are able to adapt our readings to suit the
				recipient.

			<h2 className="flex justify-center pb-2">Living tributes</h2>
			<p>
				Living Tributes are performed for a nurse in recognition and
				gratitude for their service. This service is different from a
				memorial service since it is directed to the nurse and their
				loved ones to thank them in person with a reading, and gifts of
				a rose and blanket. Common places for living tributes are in the
				home, hospice or nursing facility and can be small or large
				gatherings depending on the family and member&#39;s wishes.

				events where we may support the recognition of nurses in our
