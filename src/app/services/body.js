            <p>
                The memorial Nightingale Tribute is comforting to the family in
                honoring their loved one&#39;s memory and helping provide
                closure. Also, it offers fellow nurses an opportunity to
                commemorate and recognize their colleague's work while
                recognizing that nurse's unique contribution and dedication to
                healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a short ceremony (generally 2-5 minutes) and can be placed
                anywhere within the service appropriate to the traditions and
                beliefs of the recipient&#39;s faith. We are non-denominational
                and welcome all backgrounds, cultures and faiths to receive our
                services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can help coordinate the tribute within the service in
                collaboration with the family, funeral home and place of worship
                as appropriate, and are able to adapt our readings to suit the
                recipient.

            <p>
                Living Tributes are performed for a nurse in recognition and
                gratitude for their service. This service is different from a
                memorial service since it is directed to the nurse and their
                loved ones to thank them in person with a reading, and gifts of
                a rose and blanket. Common places for living tributes are in the
                home, hospice or nursing facility and can be small or large
                gatherings depending on the family and member&#39;s wishes.
