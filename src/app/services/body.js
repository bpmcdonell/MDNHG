                    The Maryland Nurse Honor Guard can provide tributes as part
                    of funeral, gravesite, memorial or celebration of life
                    services for any Maryland Registered Nurse, Licensed
                    Practical Nurse, or Nurse Practitioner.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Honor Guard services are provided free of charge to
                    families, and are based on the availability of volunteers.
                    Nursing colleagues of the deceased are welcome to
                    participate.

                    We perform The Nightingale Tribute for any fallen
                    professional nurse to be presented during the nurse&#39;s
                    funeral service.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <p>
                    The tribute offers fellow nurses an opportunity to
                    commemorate and recognize their colleague&#39;s work while
                    recognizing that nurse&#39;s unique contribution and
                    dedication to healthcare. Also it is comforting to the
                    family in honoring their loved one&#39;s memory and helping
                    provide closure.
                </p>

                    Generally it is a short ceremony generally 2-5 minutes and
                    can be placed anywhere within the service appropriate to the
                    traditions and beliefs of the recipient&#39;s faith. We are
                    non- denominational and welcome all backgrounds, cultures
                    and faiths to receive our services. We can help coordinate
                    the tribute within the service in collaboration with the
                    family, funeral home and place of worship as appropriate,
                    and are able to adapt our readings to suit the recipient.
