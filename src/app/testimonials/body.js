                    "The Maryland Nurses Honor Guard was a great comfort to me
                    and my family when my mother passed away. They were
                    professional, compassionate, and respectful. They were
                    especially kind to my father, who was a retired nurse. I
                    would highly recommend them to any family who has lost a
                    loved one."

                    "I have been a nurse for over 40 years and have seen many
                    things in my career. I was so moved by the ceremony that the
                    Maryland Nurses Honor Guard performed at my friend's
                    funeral. The respect and dignity they showed to my friend
                    and her family was truly touching. I am so grateful to them
                    for their service."
