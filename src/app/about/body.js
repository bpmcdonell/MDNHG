                    The Maryland Nurse Honor Guard considers it a privilege to
                    participate in the memorial services of fellow nurses to
                    celebrate and recognize those who have dedicated their lives
                    to the profession of nursing.

                <p>
                    We are a group of active and retired professional nurses who
                    volunteer our time to pay tribute to our fallen colleagues
                    at their funeral or memorial service.<br></br>
                    Our service is steeped in nursing tradition and embraces the
                    symbolism of our nursing uniform and presentation of a
                    nursing lamp to the family after a Nightingale Tribute and
                    Last Roll Call releasing the nurse from their duties with
                    honor.<br></br>
                    It is similar to a military tribute, and it is our mission
                    to be able to provide this service free of charge to any
                    Maryland resident who was a Registered Nurse, Licensed
                    Practical Nurse, Nurse Practitioner or other nurse
                    specialist in our state. The presence of the Nurse Honor
                    Guard hopes to be a source of comfort to the family and a
                    celebration of the nurse's service.<br></br>
                    Also we offer Living Tributes to any nurse that may be near
                    the end of their life so we may honor them in person and
                    thank them for their service.
