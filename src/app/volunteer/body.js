					Nursing is giving of oneself to enhance the lives of others.
					It is appropriate that we honor our colleagues not only
					during their career, but also at the end of life&#39;s
					journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					The nurses who are members of the Honor Guard consider it
					both an honor and a privilege to participate in final
					services for their fellow nurses. Our presence gives
					meaningful recognition to the nurse who has passed and helps
					to ease the grief of their loved ones during their time of
					loss.
				</p>
				<p>
					Honor Guard nurse volunteers personally understand the
					dedication, commitment and sacrifices required of nurses
					throughout their careers. We are humbled in gratitude to our
					fallen nurse colleagues and their families for all they have
					given. Our volunteers share the value that our colleagues
					deserve recognition of their service with dignity and
					respect, and we enjoy camaraderie in carrying out our
					collective mission.

				<p>
					Maryland Nurse Honor Guard volunteers are active or retired
					professional nurses who may reside anywhere in the state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our nurse volunteers do not pay dues, but provide their own
					uniforms, time and transportation.
				</p>
				<p>
					We wear a traditional formal white nursing uniform with cap
					and cape similar to nurses during WW1. The uniform dignified
					nursing and symbolizes the establishment of professional
					nursing as we know it today.
				</p>
				{/* there needs to be a space here or maybe be added into the "volunteering" section */}
				<p>
					We do not have a specified time commitment to be a volunteer
					but appreciate some flexibility to attend services as needed
					to meet our mission. Given the nature of death, we realize
					that we may be called at any time. We may be invited to two
					or more services at the same time. Attendance will depend on
					how many volunteers are available.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are always looking for more volunteers to serve the 23
					counties of Maryland. Our goal is to have enough volunteers
					across the state to share scheduling our time, and allowing
					volunteers to participate even if they have limited
					availability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Volunteers can also support MDNHG through Fundraising,
					Advertising, Social Media, Phone calls, Coordination of
					services and much more.
