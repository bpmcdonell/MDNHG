                    Nursing is giving of oneself to enhance the lives of others.
                    It is appropriate that we honor our colleagues not only
                    during their career, but also at the end of life&#39;s
                    journey.

                    The nurses who are members of the Honor Guard consider it
                    both an honor and a privilege to participate in final
                    services for their fellow nurses. Our presence gives
                    meaningful recognition to the nurse who has passed and helps
                    to ease the grief.
                </p>

                    Honor Guard nurse volunteers personally understand the
                    dedication, commitment and sacrifices required of nurses
                    throughout their careers. We are humbled in gratitude to our
                    fallen nurse colleagues and their families for all they have
                    given. Our volunteers share the value that our colleagues
                    deserve recognition of their service with dignity and
                    respect, and we enjoy camaraderie in carrying out our
                    collective mission.

                    Maryland Nurse Honor Guard volunteers are active or retired
                    professional nurses who may reside anywhere in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our nurse volunteers do not pay dues, but provide their own
                    uniforms, time and transportation.
                </p>

                    We wear a traditional nursing dress uniform of cap and cape
                    over a full white uniform. The white cap with navy stripe,
                    and navy with red lining cape represents uniforms
                    originating during the first world war in effort to recruit
                    and train nurses. The uniform dignified nursing and
                    symbolizes the establishment of professional nursing as we
                    know it today.

                    Volunteers can be as active as they choose. We do not have a
                    specified time commitment to be a volunteer but appreciate
                    some ability to attend services as needed to meet our
                    mission. Given the nature of death, we realize that we may
                    be called at any time. We may be invited to two or more
                    services at the same time. Attendance will depend on how
                    many volunteers are available.

                    We are always looking for more volunteers to serve all the
                    counties of Maryland. Our goal is to have enough volunteers
                    across the state to share scheduling our time, and allowing
                    volunteers to participate even if they have limited
                    availability.

                    For volunteers who are not able to attend tribute services
                    or who are not nurses but would still like participate the
                    NHG we still can use support for fundraising, advertising,
                    social media, phone calls, coordination of services, and
                    more!
