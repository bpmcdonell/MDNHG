                    As nurses attending services for colleagues witness what we
                    do many choose to become a part of it.

                    The Honor Guard&#39;s presence gives meaningful recognition
                    to the nurse who has passed, and helps to ease mourner&#39;s
                    grief during their time of loss.

                    The nurses who are members of the Honor Guard consider it
                    both an honor and a privilege to participate in final
                    services for their fellow nurses.

                    Nursing is a calling; it is giving of oneself to enhance the
                    lives of others. Nursing is a service profession that cannot
                    be lived in isolation. Nurses rely on each other for
                    teamwork in our efforts of care giving. When a gentle touch,
                    a firm push, or an encouraging word was needed, our nurses
                    were there. To witness humanity, its beauty, in good times
                    and bad, without judgment, our nurses were there. To embrace
                    the woes of the world willingly, and offer hope, our nurses
                    were there. And so, too, are nurses who volunteer for the
                    Honor Guard for nurses&#39; funerals. It is appropriate that
                    we honor our colleagues not only during their career, but
                    also at the end of life&#39;s journey.

                    Honor Guard members wear a traditional nursing cap and cape

                    traditional white uniform complete with cap and cape.
