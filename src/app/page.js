            <h1>Maryland Nurse&#39;s Honor Guard</h1>
            <p>
                Nursing is a calling, and a way of life. Nurses rely on each
                other for teamwork in our efforts of caregiving. It is
                appropriate that we honor our colleagues not only during their
                career, but also at the end of life&#39;s journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Maryland Nurse Honor Guard considers it a privilege to
                participate in the memorial services of fellow nurses to
                celebrate and recognize those who have dedicated their lives to
                the profession of nursing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are a not-for-profit group of active and retired professional
                nurses who volunteer our time to pay tribute to our colleagues
                at their memorial services.
            </p>
            <p>
                MISSION &#8211; To honor nurse colleagues who have passed on and
                provide comfort to their families by providing a Nightingale
                Tribute ceremony.
            </p>
            <p>
                VISION &#8211; To honor every nurse who passes in the State of
                Maryland.
            </p>
            <p>
                PURPOSE &#8211; To recognize professional nurses and their
                contributions to society by honoring their life&#39;s work in a
                memorial service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our service is steeped in nursing tradition embracing the
                symbolism of our nursing uniform and presentation of a nursing
                lamp to the family after a Nightingale Tribute and Last Roll
                Call releasing the nurse from their duties with honor.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is similar to a military tribute, and it is our mission to be
                able to provide this service free of charge to any Maryland
                resident who was a Registered Nurse, Licensed Practical Nurse,
                Nurse Practitioner or other nurse specialist in our state. The
                presence of the Nurse Honor Guard hopes to be a source of
                comfort to the family and a celebration of the nurse&#39;s
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also we offer Living Tributes to any nurse that may be near the
                end of their life so we may honor them in person and thank them
                for their service.
